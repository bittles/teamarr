Filter Reasons - Single Source of Truth

Centralized definitions for all stream filtering and event matching reasons.
These constants are used throughout the codebase for consistency in:
- Event matcher results
- Preview modal display
- Statistics tracking
- Logging

Usage:

    # In event_matcher.py
    result['reason'] = FilterReason.GAME_FINAL_EXCLUDED

    # In UI/templates
